# =============================================================================
# Variant 5: Single Task - DAG Only (DINOv2)
# =============================================================================
# Tests the contribution of multi-task learning by training only on DAG prediction.
# This variant uses:
# - DINOv2-base image encoder (768-dim)
# - All modalities: image, fluorescence, environment, watering
# - Temporal transformer with 2 layers
# - Only DAG regression and classification heads active
# - Biomass and trajectory tasks disabled (loss weight = 0)
#
# Expected: Performance change indicates multi-task learning effects

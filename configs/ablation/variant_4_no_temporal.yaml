# =============================================================================
# Variant 4: No Temporal (DINOv2)
# =============================================================================
# Tests the contribution of temporal modeling by replacing the temporal transformer
# with mean pooling across timepoints.
# This variant uses:
# - DINOv2-base image encoder (768-dim)
# - All modalities: image, fluorescence, environment, vegetation indices
# - Mean pooling instead of temporal transformer (no temporal dependencies)
# - All 4 task heads remain active
#
# Expected: Performance drop indicates importance of temporal dynamics

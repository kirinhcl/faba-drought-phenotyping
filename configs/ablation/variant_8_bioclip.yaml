# =============================================================================
# Variant 8: BioCLIP Backbone (ImageOmics BioCLIP)
# =============================================================================
# Tests the contribution of the image encoder by replacing DINOv2 with BioCLIP.
# This variant uses:
# - ImageOmics BioCLIP image encoder (768-dim output)
# - Frozen encoder (same as DINOv2 baseline)
# - All modalities: image, fluorescence, environment, vegetation indices
# - Temporal transformer with 2 layers
# - All 4 task heads remain active
#
# Expected: Performance difference indicates encoder architecture/pretraining effects
# BioCLIP is trained on biological images, so may have better inductive bias for plants

model:
  image_encoder: "imageomics/bioclip"

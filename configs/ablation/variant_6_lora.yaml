# =============================================================================
# Variant 6: DINOv2 with LoRA Fine-tuning
# =============================================================================
# Tests parameter-efficient fine-tuning using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA).
# This variant uses:
# - DINOv2-base image encoder with LoRA adapters (rank=8)
# - Encoder is NOT frozen — LoRA modules are trainable
# - All modalities: image, fluorescence, environment, watering
# - Temporal transformer with 2 layers
# - All 4 task heads remain active
#
# NOTE: LoRA fine-tuning requires runtime feature extraction (not pre-extracted).
# The training script must detect this config and extract features on-the-fly
# instead of loading pre-computed features from disk.
#
# Expected: Comparable or better performance with fewer trainable parameters

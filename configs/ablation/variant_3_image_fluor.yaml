# =============================================================================
# Variant 3: Image + Fluorescence (DINOv2)
# =============================================================================
# Tests the contribution of fluorescence data while removing environment and watering.
# This variant combines:
# - DINOv2-base image encoder (768-dim)
# - Fluorescence features (~93-96 params)
# - Temporal transformer processes image + fluorescence
# - Environment and watering inputs are disabled
# - All 4 task heads remain active
#
# Expected: Intermediate performance between image-only and full model

model:
  ablation:
    use_fluorescence: true
    use_environment: false
    use_watering: false

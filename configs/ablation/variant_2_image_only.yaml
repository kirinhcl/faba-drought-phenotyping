# =============================================================================
# Variant 2: Image-Only Temporal (DINOv2)
# =============================================================================
# Tests the contribution of non-image modalities (fluorescence, environment, vegetation indices).
# This variant removes all auxiliary inputs and uses only image features:
# - DINOv2-base image encoder (768-dim)
# - Temporal transformer processes image features only
# - Fluorescence, environment, and vegetation index inputs are disabled
# - All 4 task heads remain active
#
# Expected: Performance drop indicates importance of auxiliary modalities

# =============================================================================
# Variant 1: Full Model (DINOv2)
# =============================================================================
# Baseline ablation variant using all default settings.
# This variant tests the complete model with:
# - DINOv2-base image encoder
# - All modalities: image, fluorescence, environment, watering
# - Temporal transformer with 2 layers
# - All 4 task heads: DAG regression/classification, biomass, trajectory
# - Multi-task learning with balanced loss weights
#
# This file is intentionally minimal — it inherits all settings from default.yaml
# and serves as the reference point for all other ablation variants.

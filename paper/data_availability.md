# Data Availability

## Raw Data
Raw RGB images (~11,600 images) and chlorophyll fluorescence measurements from the faba bean drought phenotyping experiment are available. The dataset comprises 264 plants across 44 accessions, 2 watering treatments, 3 replicates, and 22 imaging rounds. Upon acceptance, the complete dataset will be deposited on Zenodo with open access (DOI: 10.XXXX/zenodo.XXXXXXX).

## Processed Features
Processed features extracted using DINOv2, CLIP, and BioCLIP models in HDF5 format are available upon request from the corresponding author.

## Metadata and Parameters
Plant metadata, experimental parameters, and detailed phenotyping protocols are included in the code repository.
